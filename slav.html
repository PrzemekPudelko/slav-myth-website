        <h3>The Creation of the World</h3>
        <p class ="mono">
            First there was nothing but chaos, everything was one. Then the ancient god <span>Rod</span> came down to earth in a golden egg, and set himself to work. First, he decided to divide the light and the darkness, and of the golden egg there rolled out the sun, illuminating all around. Behind came the moon, taking its place in the sky and the night.  Then he created the vast waters around the world, and after that the vast land arose. From this land trees started to grow, animals stepped out of the forests and birds started to sing. He created a rainbow, to divide the land and the sea, the truth and falsehood. Then, standing upon the golden egg, <span>Rod</span> stopped for a moment and looked around! He was satisfied with the fruits of his labor but he decided some things still miss in this world so the God breathed on the ground – and the wind rustled in the trees and out of his breath was born the goddess of love <span>Lada</span>. He divided world into three kingdoms: Heaven, Earth and the Underworld. First he created the Gods, who must keep order on the ground, then he created men, and lastly a haven for the dead. In the creation of three kingdoms through them a gigantic oak started to grow – the World Tree, which has grown from the seed thrown by the creator. Its roots are hidden in the world of the dead, bore passes through the earthly kingdom and the crown supporting the sky and heaven. He populated the kingdom of heaven by Gods. Then he together with <span>Lada</span> created a mighty god <span>Svarog</span>. Breathing life into him, <span>Svarog</span> became the loyal assistant to the all creator <span>Rod</span>: he paved the path of the sun across the sky and the path of the moon in the sky of the night.

        <p class ="mono" id="smp1"> 
            Originating in ancient times, the evil god <span>Chernobog</span> – the lord of darkness had his mind overwhelmed by injustice and gloomy thought. He succumbed to the temptations of the world and planned to subjugate it, so he turned into the Black Serpent and crawled out of his lair. <span>Svarog</span> was the god that kept an eye on the world, as he sensed something was wrong, so he went to his forge and struck his mighty hammer against the fiery forge to create himself more gods to help him. The first born of the forge's fire was <span>Dazhbog</span>, then <span>Horse</span>; <span>Stribog</span> and <span>Simargl</span> followed. While new gods were created the Black Serpent crawled upon the land to corrupt it and the men that lived upon it. <span>Svarog</span> sent <span>Dazhbog</span> and <span>Simargl</span> to see what is happening in the land of men, and saw that many had already been corrupted by <span>Chernobog</span> and a war was about to start. Returning to the Nav <span>Svarog</span> was informed by his sons that a war between good and evil will start. <span>Svarog</span> heard them and began striking his celestial forge to arm up his army, because to defeat <span>Chernobog</span> he had to fight with luminous intensity. <span>Chernobog</span> corrupted men so much that him and his evil world forces eventually fought their way into the heavenly palace on top of the world tree, in their madness they started to invade <span>Svarog's</span> world forge itself. Quickly, <span>Svarog</span> created a magical chest and as soon as <span>Chernobog</span> appeared on the forges doorway, <span>Svarog</span> called for the aid of his children Gods, and together they overcame the serpent. Finally capturing <span>Chernobog</span> in the chest, the cursed black god was defeated, and in its misery he asked <span>Svarog</span> to spare his evil offspring, the men of this world. <span>Svarog</span> decided to spare men in his righteousness and because in the end he himself created men faulty as they are. However there was one condition to spare them, he told <span>Chernobog</span> that never again could the world be controlled by darkness in whole, and <span>Chernobog</span> had to agree. World of men was restored and half of the world again was covered in daylight shining from the <span>Svarog's</span> fiery forge, while other half stayed in darkness, this is how the night and day cycle came onto the world of men.
