        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p class= "fantasy">
            The Witcher was originally a Polish book series written by Andrzej Sapkowski. It was been turned into a very popular videogame series by Polish company CD Projekt Red, and is undergoing a TV rendition by Netflix. The Witcher incorporates man features from Slavic mythology, especially the numerous creatures found in the stories, but makes them much more dangerous. They are so dangerous, in fact, that mutants were specifically designed to hunt down and kill these monsters. These mutants are known as witchers.

        <h3>Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, Humans</h3>
        <p class="fantasy" id="wp1">
            In the Witcher universe, Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, and many more creatures exist. However, these sentient species are constantly being pushed out of their territories by humans, who have children much faster than the other species. Elves are a tall and slender race that is among the most oppressed in the Witcher series; they are at the brink of extinction. Dwarves seem to be viewed more favorably by humans than the other species, but are still looked down upon for their short stature. Little is known of Gnomes. They are smaller than dwarves, but are master craftsmen and blacksmiths. In the first Witcher videogame, tiny Gnomes, small enough to hide under a mushroom cap, can be found running around in a tomb. In Polish, these Gnomes are called Krasnoludki, a beloved piece of Polish fairytales.</p>
        <h3>Monsters</h3>
        <p class="fantasy">
            As said before, the Witcher takes regular creatures that tend to be little more than a nuisance in regular Slavic folk stories, and turns them into full blown monsters capable of killing people. These include Chorts, Gargoyles, Ghouls, Griffins, Basilisks, Vampires, Leshens, Djinns, Drowners, Kikimoras, Endregas, and many, many more. Perhaps the most famous of these monsters are The Crones of Crookback Bog. These crones are based on Baba Yaga, a witch, or 3 witches, depending on the stories, who is used to scare children at night. The Crones are hideous monsters that feast on children to maintain their youth, and are the de facto Gods of Velen, a wartorn swamp in the Witcher Universe. It is Geralts job to destroy monsters such as these to protect humans. </p>
