        <h1>Polish Mythology and Fairytales</h1>
        <p id="div2">
            Welcome to my page on Polish Mythology and Fairytales. My name is Przemyslaw Pudelko. This is a project for my Web Programming Class. Below, you will find links to 3 different pages under each image, and a basic description of Polish mythology.</p>

            Polish mythology is a very expansive topic. It can range from ancient Slavic mythology, to the fairytales of how Poland and its major cities were founded, all the way to the Witcher series's new takes on Slavic myths and beings. Obviously, there is going to be some overlap between the 3 of these, as they are all a part of Polish Mythology. On the left, you see a caption under each photo. These captions function as links to each of the 3 topics that I have mentioned.
