        <h3>The Founding of Poland</h3>
        <p class ="cursive">
            Long ago, 3 brothers named Lech, Czech, and Rus were traveling across Eastern Europe, looking for a place to settle their people. One day, Lech went walked with a few of his soldiers, and came upon a giant tree on a hill with an eagle's nest on one of its branches. Perched near the nest was a pure white eagle. Lech ordered his one of his soldiers to get one of the eggs for him from the nest. However, everytime the soldier got close to the nest, the eagle would swoop down and claw at his face. Eventually, amazed by the eagle's vigor in protecting its eggs, Lech called his soldier off. He then turned to his men and said, "Here is were I will found my country and where my people shall live, and I will protect this land and my people just as this eagle has protected its eggs. And this place will be called Gniezno, because it is where the nest is found." From then on, Poland existed as a nation, Gniezno was its capital, and a pure white Eagle with a crown on its head was its coat of arms. As for Lech's brothers, Czech went south and founded Czechia, while Rus went East and founded Ruthenia. </p>

        <p class ="cursive" id ="fp1">
            In southern Poland, there exists a city name Krakow, and back when this city was still small, there was a hill nearby named Wawel. At the base of this hill exists a cave. One day, a group of young Krakowiaks went to explore the cave, and discovered a sleeping dragon. They accidentally awoke it, and from that point on the dragon terrorized the citizens of Krakow, stealing their animals and burning their buildings. As this went on, their king Krak lamented, because none of his knights was capable of defeating the dragon. Finally, a young cobbler appeared before him, and told him that he would slay the dragon, if the king would give him his daughter in marriage. The king agreed, and the cobbler immediately went to work. He butchered a sheep, removed its innards, stuffed it with pitch and sulfur, and sowed it back up. He then placed it outside of the dragon's den. Eventually, the dragon came out, and seeing the easy target, gobbled the sheep up. Then, it started to feel a burning in its chest, and rushed down to the Wisla river the extinguish the pain. The dragon drank and drank, but the burning would not be relieved. It drank, and drank, and drank, until it burst! The cobbler returned triumphant to King Krak, who, as promised, gave his daughter in marriage. The king decided to build on Wawel Hill a castle, as it was a very strategic location, and it is on that hill that today's Wawel Castle is found.

            In the center of Poland, along the Wisla river, a man and his pregnant wife sat down in the location that is now the current capital of Poland, Warszawa. The man went down to the river to catch some fish, and lo! A mermaid, with a shield and a sword, appeared out of the water before the man. She said to him, "Settle here, for it will become a prosperous and great city. You will have 2 children, a boy and a girl. Name your boy 'War' and your girl 'Szawa'." The man, understanding the message, agreed, thanked the mermaid, and ran back to his wife, telling her the story. He and his wife did exactly as the mermaid said, and, through their children, came to found the city Warszawa, whose coat of arms is a Mermaid armed with a shield and a sword.
